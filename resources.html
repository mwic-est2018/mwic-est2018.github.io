									Make an Impact.  Be a part of a movement like none you've ever experienced. Politics does matter if you're not represented, your voice is lost.

An intensive, non-partisan, five-day residential program, NEW Leadership Ohio educates Ohio college women about politics and policy-making to actively engage them in the political process.

								<h3>Carol Shaw</h3>
								<p>
									Carol Shaw (born 1955) is a former video game designer, notable for being one of the first female designers in the video game industry. While working at Atari, Inc. in 1978, Shaw designed the unreleased Polo game and designed 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe the same year, both for the Atari 2600.
									<br><br>
									History: <br>
									Her father was a mechanical engineer and worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. She did not enjoy the stereotypical girl activities as a child like playing with dolls. Instead, she would mess with her brother's model railroad set. Shaw first became interested in computers in high school when she used a computer for the first time and discovered she could play text-based games on the system. Shaw attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 1977. She went on to complete a master's degree in Computer Science at Berkeley.
									<br><br>
									Career: <br>
									While working at Atari, Inc. in 1978, Shaw designed the unreleased Polo game and designed 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe the same year, both for the Atari 2600. She left Atari in 1980 to work for Tandem Computers. Shaw joined Activision in 1982. Her first game was River Raid (1982) for the Atari 2600, which was inspired by the 1981 arcade game Scramble. She took early retirement in 1990 and subsequently did some voluntary work including a position at the Foresight Institute. She has credited the success of River Rai as being a significant factor in enabling her to retire early. In 2017, Shaw won the Industry Icon Award at The Game Awards.
